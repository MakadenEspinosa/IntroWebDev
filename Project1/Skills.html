                            I am new to most languages outside of Java, Python, and C++. I have the most expirence in Java, which I have 5 years expirence in learning and developing in. 
                            I am learning JavaScript, TypeScript, and more C languages currently.

                            I am not a scratch golfer by any means, but I really enjoy the sport. I would say that my average handicap is 85-95. While I am not great at putting (Big skill issue)
                            I can get the ball to the green well. I shoot my irons well, my woods and driver get me far, and my wedge usually lies me well. I just can't putt to save my life.

                        <h3 id="cooking-heading">Cooking</h3>
                        <p>
                            I enjoy cooking quite a lot, and love trying new recipies on the weekend. 
                            My favorite thing to make is Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, but I also can make some mean Hibachi meals.
                            I also sometimes like baking cookies and pastries on special occasions. Cooking to me is a fun pastime that I have slowly improved at over time. 
                            It is a great expirence to have since it keeps me fed.
