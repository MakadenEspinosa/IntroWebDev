                        <p>
                            After graduating Neumont my first goal is to find a stable job. I do not think I want to go for my dream posistion right off the bat before gaining aqequate industry expirence first.
                            I want to have at least 5 years of expirence before I start making my big dreams a possiblility, because I want to make sure I am adequate enough to keep the job that I thruly want. 
                            I plan to look for work in Texas around the Houston or Dallas areas, as I believe those will be my best shots. 
                            Even if I land a fairly upper paying job to sustain just myself I do not want to live expensive. My first goal is to eliminate as much of my debt as I possibly can as quickly as I can. 
                            I have many financial plans to ensure that this is accomplished. 
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="life-goals">Hopes for Life</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, I just want a life where I can be with my family. There is much to explore in the world that would be difficult to explore without being a part from my loved ones,
                            but there has been no greater joys in my life than being with the ones I care for the most. To provide for my family, and give back to them all of the blessings they have given to me is my greatest desire. 
                            A good job is an important role in this dream, but as long as I have my family I will have the true happiness I desire. We have gotten through so much together, and I do not doubt we have many more feats to brave together. 
                        </p>
