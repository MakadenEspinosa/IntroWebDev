Thank you for viewing my repository! This is a repository of html webpage projects I have completed for Introductory Web Development.
Currently there are the following:
"Project1" - This is my final project which consists of a portfolio about me.
"WonderfulWeather" - This is a weather widget assignment that gives the current weather in a specified United States city.
